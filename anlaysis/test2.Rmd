## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r code chucnk title, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width= 8, fig.height = 5}

x <- rnorm(100)

mean(x, na.rm = FALSE)

hist(x, main = "hisotryof random numbers", col= "skyblue")

message("this is a sample message")

```
